            <h1 id="4-number-game">4 Number Game</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://www.4nums.com">4 number game</a> is a well known arithmetic puzzle that
can be played in groups. You are presented with four numbers, e.g. 1 1 11 11,
and are given the goal to make 24 by using the arithmetic operators <code>+</code>, <code>*</code>,
<code>-</code>, <code>/</code> and liberal use of parenthesis.</p>
<p>As the below code shows, adding all the numbers will solve the puzzle.</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">(+ 1 1 11 11)</code></pre>

<p>In this blog post we will explore code that can find solutions to these puzzles.
One puzzle that is a little more interesting than the other is to try to make 24
with 1 3 8 8.</p>
<h2 id="solution-path">Solution Path</h2>
<p>Every arithmetic expression, e.g. <code>1 + 2 * 3</code>, can be seen as a a tree. In
this case the tree would be</p>
<pre><code>  +
 / \
1   *
   / \
  2   3
</code></pre><p>This tree tells us that we need to add <code>1</code> and the product of <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>. I we
squint with our eyes and only take into account the structure of the tree, we
would see the following </p>
<pre><code>
 / \

   / \
</code></pre><p>The only thing that is missing from this tree are the operators, which should go
into the internal positions of the tree, and the numbers, which should go in the
leaf positions.</p>
<p>So our solution will be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate all the possible tree structures</li>
<li>Decorate a tree structure with all possible operators and all possible values</li>
<li>Evaluate an expression tree</li>
<li>Putting it together</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="generating-all-tree-structures">Generating all tree structures</h2>
<p>In the following code snippet we generate all the tree structures with only one
internal node. There is only one, which can be seen.</p>
<pre><code class="clojure" data-external-libs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dvberkel/flippo/master/src">
(require '[flippo.tree :refer [generate-structure-tree]])

(generate-structure-tree 1)
</code></pre>

<p>This blog post is enhanced with <a href="https://github.com/viebel/klipse">klipse</a>,
which means that all code snippets are interactive. Go ahead and change the
number and see the corresponding tree structures.</p>
<p>How can one generate these structures?</p>
<p>Let&#39;s first think of growing a single tree. Below we have a tree with two
internal node that corresponds to the arithmetic expression from the solution
path section. </p>
<pre><code class="clojure">
(def tree {:left nil, :right {:left nil, :right nil}})
</code></pre>

<p>We can visualize the <code>nil</code> position as buds ready to spring a new tree part. So
in order to grow our tree we could try to adjoin a part to all buds.</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">
(defn adjoin [tree part]
  "Returns a sequence of structured trees where part is adjoined to
   all the buds in tree"
  (if (nil? tree)
    (seq [part])
    (concat
     (map (fn [t] {:left t :right (:right tree)}) (adjoin (:left tree) part))
     (map (fn [t] {:left (:left tree) :right t}) (adjoin (:right tree) part)))))

(adjoin tree :A)
</code></pre>

<p>Here we adjoined a keyword <code>:A</code> and we see that we get three new tree
structures. Try to adjoin a small tree structure <code>{:left nil :right nil}</code>.</p>
<p>This is the basis of the <code>generate-structure-tree</code> algorithm. There is only one
tree with zero internal nodes, i.e. <code>nil</code>. It can serve as a basis to sprout
small trees from the buds. Doing this recursively gives us our algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="decorate-a-tree-structure">Decorate a Tree Structure</h2>
<p>Now that we can generate tree structures, we would like to decorate them with
tree operators and values. The basic algorithm for that is visiting all nodes in
the tree and assign values to the leaves and operator to the internal nodes.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generator_(computer_programming">generator</a>
helps us in this case. We could use it to request the next value we haven&#39;t use.
Lets implement a generator.</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">
(defn generator [elements]
  "Creates a generator that loops through the vector elements"
  (let [index (atom 0)]
    (fn []
      (let [current-index @index]
        (do
          (swap! index #(mod (inc %) (count elements)))
          (nth elements current-index))))))

(def keyword-generator (generator [:A :B :C]))

(keyword-generator)
(keyword-generator)
</code></pre>

<p>Our <code>generator</code> is a high-order function in the sense that it returns a
function. The function closes over an <a href="http://clojure.org/reference/atoms">atom</a>
that keeps track of an index. The index is used to retrieve an element from the
elements provided as an argument to <code>generator</code> call.</p>
<p>We created a keyword generator and called it twice. This returns <code>:B</code>. Add a new
call to <code>keyword-generator</code> and it will cycle through the values <code>:A</code>, <code>:B</code> and
<code>:C</code>. </p>
<p>How can we use this?</p>
<p>Lets assume we have a tree that we want to decorate. Furthermore, we have an
generator that cycles through a selection of operators, e.g. <code>*</code> and <code>+</code>, and a
generator that cycles through some values, e.g. <code>1</code>, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>. What we could
do is walk the tree and transform it in the following fashion. For each internal
node of the tree, request and operator from the operator generator, and
associate it with that node. Furthermore, for each leaf node, request a value
from the value generator and make a value node.</p>
<p>The only unknown is the question: how to traverse a tree. Lets implement it
right away.</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">
(defn map-tree [f tree]
  "Let f operate on all the nodes of the tree"
  (if (nil? tree)
    (f tree nil nil)
    (f tree (map-tree f (:left tree)) (map-tree f (:right tree)))))
</code></pre>

<p><code>map-tree</code> takes a function <code>f</code> and a tree and applies each node of the tree,
together with its two children to <code>f</code>. We can use it to decorate the tree with
the operators and values.</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">
(defn decorate [operators values tree]
  "Transforms a structured tree into a tree ready for evaluation. It walks the tree
   and transform nil nodes into value-nodes, and non-nil nodes into operator nodes.
   This is done in a cyclic fashion, both for the operators and the values."
  (let [
        operator-generator (generator operators)
        value-generator    (generator values)
        transformer        (fn [tree left right]
                             (if (nil? tree)
                               {:value (value-generator)}
                               {:operator (operator-generator) :left left :right right}))]
    (map-tree transformer tree)))

(decorate '[* +] [1 2 3] {:left nil :right {:left nil :right nil}})
</code></pre>

<p>It seems to have worked. Make sure to try different operators, values and tree.
Then move on to the next phase. Note that we have quoted the list of operators.
This is to clean up the output. See what happens when you remove the <code>&#39;</code>.</p>
<h2 id="evaluating-a-tree">Evaluating a Tree</h2>
<p>Now that we have a abstract syntax tree of our arithmetic expression, we want to
evaluate it. Evaluation is nothing more than applying the correct operation to
the (evaluated) value of the left sub-tree and the (evaluated) value of the
right sub-tree.</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">
(defn evaluate [tree]
  "Evaluates a tree representation like {:operator + :left {:value 1} :right {:value 2}}
   to the corresponding value, i.e. 3."
  (if (:operator tree)
    ((:operator tree) 
      (evaluate (:left tree)) 
      (evaluate (:right tree)))
    (:value tree)))

(def tree (decorate [* +] [1 2 3] {:left nil :right {:left nil :right nil}}))

(evaluate tree)
</code></pre>

<p>The tree in the above snippet represents the calculation <code>1 + (2 * 3)</code>, so it
produces the correct answer. There is only one problem that could occur. If we
would allow the operator <code>/</code> and the value <code>0</code>, possibly this could lead to a
divide by zero answer. A <code>safe-evaluate</code> would catch this <code>ArithmeticException</code>
and just return <code>nil</code>.</p>
<h2 id="putting-it-together">Putting it Together</h2>
<p>If you have experimented with the tree decorations, you may have noticed that
the order the operators are listed is important. If instead of first applying
<code>*</code> and than <code>+</code>, you reverse the order, the answer is different.</p>
<p>So we should try to have all possible selections of operators and all
permutation of values and each try them on a tree. Luckily there is a nice
library that provides these functions.</p>
<pre><code class="clojure" data-external-libs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viebel/math.combinatorics/master/src/main/clojure">
(require '[clojure.math.combinatorics :refer [permutations selections]])

(permutations [:A :B :C])
</code></pre>

<p>Above we see all possible permutations of three elements. This is ideal for
trying out all possible assignments of values, because no value is repeated. For
a given puzzle we can use each value only once.</p>
<p>We need something else if we want to try out all assignments of operators, because
the same operator can be used multiple times. Luckily the
<code>clojure.math.combinatorics</code> library also provides <code>selections</code></p>
<pre><code class="clojure">
(require '[clojure.math.combinatorics :refer [permutations selections]])

(selections [:A :B :C] 2)
</code></pre>

<p>Here we see all possible two element sequence drawn from the vector <code>[:A :B
:C]</code>. We can use that in order to solve our puzzle. The algorithm is</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate all possible selection of operators.</li>
<li>Generate all possible permutation of values.</li>
<li>Generate all structure trees.</li>
<li>Decorate each combination of trees with operators and values.</li>
<li>Filter the ones that do not reach the target.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="clojure">
(require '[clojure.math.combinatorics :refer [permutations selections]]
         '[flippo.tree :refer [generate-structure-tree]])

(defn solve
  ([operators target values]
   "Returns all trees that use operators to form target"
   (filter #(= target (evaluate %))
           (let [nodes (dec (count values))]
             (for [os (selections operators nodes)
                   vs (permutations values)
                   tree (generate-structure-tree nodes)]
               (decorate os vs tree))))))
</code></pre>

<p>We can use that to solve our puzzle</p>
<pre><code class="clojure" data-external-libs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dvberkel/flippo/master/src">
(require '[flippo.solution :refer [solve]]
         '[flippo.representation :refer [infix]])

(map infix (solve [* + - /] 24 [1 3 8 8]))
