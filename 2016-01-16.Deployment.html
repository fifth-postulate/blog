<h1>Deployment of blog</h1>

<p>I am working on a blog engine and have set up the means to transform a markdown
file to html. I used the <a href="https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js">markdown</a> for the actual
transformation. It has the added benefit that it can produce an intermediate
abstract syntax tree representation. This could be useful in the future.</p>

<p>As can be seen in the <a href="https://github.com/fifth-postulate/blog/tree/2a8d28454f49e0611266911b1e0ee28d91a8dca8">last commit</a> there is still some improvement in
the transformation code. For example the <code>error</code> variable is shadowed multiple
times and already the dreaded callback hell is showing. I intend to start using
promises the flatten the logic.</p>

<p>But before doing that I would like to look into deploying the code to GitHub
pages automatically.</p>
