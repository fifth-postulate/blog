            <h1>Creating an Index</h1>

<p>I was able to deploy the blog to GitHub. The most interesting part was acquiring
a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/">access token</a>. An access token is used to authenticate a user
and is intended to be used in automated scripts.</p>

<p>Because access tokens enable you to interact with your repository it should be
kept secret. I did this by creating a <code>.bash_tokens</code> file outside version
control that sets and exports <code>GH_TOKEN</code> that can be used in a deploy script.</p>

<p>With the most important parts out of the way, it is time to creating an index of
posts. At the moment you should already know the posts before you can reach it,
which is sub-optimal.</p>
