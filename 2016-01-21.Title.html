            <h1>Better titles</h1>

<p>Yesterday I worked on some styling. At the moment it is very minimal. Basically</p>

<p><code>css
.content {
    max-width: 480px;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}
</code></p>

<p>Nonetheless, it still improved the overall appearance of the blog. I will get to
better styling in due time.</p>

<p>The next thing I want to improve are the titles. At the moment they are just the
file names, which is a bit hard on the eyes. The plan is to read the first line
of each post and use that for the title.</p>
