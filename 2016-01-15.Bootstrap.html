<h1>Bootstrapping a Blog</h1>

<p>I am starting a professional blog for Fifth Postulate. Because having good
topics to talk about is one of the hardest parts of blogging, I am starting out
by building my own blog engine.</p>

<p>Below is a vague list of what I want</p>

<ul><li>Use markdown</li><li>Deploy to GitHub pages</li></ul>

<p>I will document my progress by writing blog posts. We will see how this blog
develops.</p>
