# Better titles

Yesterday I worked on some styling. At the moment it is very minimal. Basically

    .content {
        max-width: 480px;
        margin-left: auto;
        margin-right: auto;
    }

Nonetheless, it still improved the overall appearance of the blog. I will get to
better styling in due time.

The next thing I want to improve are the titles. At the moment they are just the
file names, which is a bit hard on the eyes. The plan is to read the first line
of each post and use that for the title.
