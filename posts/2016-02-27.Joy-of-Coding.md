# Joy of Coding
[Joy of Coding][joy-of-coding] is a lovely conference focused on sharing the
love and joy of software and software development. I answered their call for
session and I got accepted.

The session that I am going to present is a workshop titled: "How to solve
permutation puzzles; with the aid of a computer". In it you will learn how to
solve permutation puzzles, like the Rubik's cube, Megaminx, Brainbow, and
others. You will do this by learning a small bit of hands-on mathematics using
the computer to do some calculations.

With these calculations you can discover moves that will help you solve the
puzzle. This is different from letting the computer solve the puzzle because a
computer does not mind 'memorizing' the shortest path whereas a person has will
be hard pressed to do just that.

I am writing a [book][] to accompany the session at Joy of Coding, so if you
want a sneak peek at the content you can find one there.
