# Deployment of blog

I am working on a blog engine and have set up the means to transform a markdown
file to html. I used the [markdown][markdown-module] for the actual
transformation. It has the added benefit that it can produce an intermediate
abstract syntax tree representation. This could be useful in the future.

As can be seen in the [last commit][2a8d2] there is still some improvement in
the transformation code. For example the `error` variable is shadowed multiple
times and already the dreaded callback hell is showing. I intend to start using
promises the flatten the logic.

But before doing that I would like to look into deploying the code to GitHub
pages automatically.
