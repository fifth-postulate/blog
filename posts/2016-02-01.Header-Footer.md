# Stick Headers and Footers

Yesterday I wanted to enable syntax highlighting for my blog posts. I ended up
with [highlight.js][]. This is a very complete syntax highlighting library that
worked out of the box with my current setup.

One thing that stood out while I worked on it was that footer runs through the
text and does not stick to the bottom as intended. Today I will make the header
and the footer sticky.
