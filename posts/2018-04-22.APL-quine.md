# An APL Quine
[APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_%28programming_language%29) is a

>  programming language developed in the 1960s by Kenneth E. Iverson. Its
>  central datatype is the multidimensional array. It uses a large range of
>  special graphic symbols to represent most functions and operators,
>  leading to very concise code. It has been an important influence on the
>  development of concept modeling, spreadsheets, functional programming,
>  and computer math packages. It has also inspired several other programming
>  languages.

I recently started studying APL. An challenging exercise in any language is to
make a [quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_%28computing%29); a program
that prints it's own source code.

Below you can find my quine in APL. Now let's hope I can understand it myself
after a month or two.

```apl
2↓40⍴20⍴¯1⌽19⍴18⍴'''2↓40⍴20⍴¯1⌽19⍴18⍴'
```
