# Weekend

Yesterday I was able to configure this repository to deploy the page on every
push. I used [Travis CI][travis-ci] for this. The most important part is a
`.travis.yml` file. This file tells Travis CI what to do with your repository.

One part is the `GH_TOKEN` that needs to be known to Travis CI. Because the
token should be handled as if it is a password it is encrypted and stored in the
`.travis.yml`. A comprehensive write up can be found in the
[Travis CI documentation][documentation]. 

Today is the start of the weekend, so I am going to take a rain check on
developing the blog further.
