# Templating

Yesterday I created an index for all the posts. I did not deal with grouping
posts according to published date, nor did I spend much time on getting a
correct title for the corresponding link. As such creating the index did very
similar to creating the posts.

So I took the time to refactor some of the code. I introduced the `promised-io`
module to the project and used it to create posts and the index. I don not
handle errors explicitly, which is something I need to look into in the future.
For now I really on the promise/A contract when there is a missing `error`
handler.

I now got the basic parts. I can create html files for the posts and the index,
and I can deploy to GitHub pages. I want to focus on a nicer template so that
the post fit right in with the website.
