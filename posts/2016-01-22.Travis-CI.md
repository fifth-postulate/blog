# Integration with Travis CI

Yesterday I opted to improve the titles of the link. The original plan was to
read the first line of the post and use that, but instead I opted to extract a
title from the file name. The reason was that I wanted to read up on today's
plan.

Although deployment is fully automated, it still is a manual step. I want to
make deploy each time I push to the GitHub repository. For this I will be using
[Travis CI][travis-ci].
