# Content Styling

Yesterday I wanted to synchronize the main style-sheet. It involved little more
than reading up on the correct options for `wget`, a command line utility. An
other option is possible, namely directly linking to the style-sheet instead of
copying it over. I will consider it in the future.

Having settled on the biggest moving parts I am going to work on the style so
that the blog will fit in nicely.
