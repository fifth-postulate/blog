# Synchronizing style-sheet

Yesterday I introduced a template engine in the mix. I settled for
[handlebars][], which has a nice load template source, compile template and us
cycle that fits nicely with promised-io way of transforming posts.

I opted to copy the style-sheet from the main website, but I am unhappy about it.
This means that I manually need to synchronize the two version. In order to
remedy that I am automating the task today.
