# Bootstrapping a Blog

I am starting a professional blog for Fifth Postulate. Because having good
topics to talk about is one of the hardest parts of blogging, I am starting out
by building my own blog engine.

Below is a vague list of what I want

* Use markdown
* Deploy to GitHub pages

I will document my progress by writing blog posts. We will see how this blog
develops.
